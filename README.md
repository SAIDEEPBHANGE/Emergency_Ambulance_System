# Android Driver Location App

## Overview

This Android application is designed for drivers to receive requested location information. The app enables drivers to input a location address, which is sent to an API server for processing. The server responds with the requested data, which is then displayed to the driver. The server-side implementation uses Google Firebase Workbench as the backend to handle incoming requests.
